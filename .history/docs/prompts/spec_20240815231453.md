## Use this package as a library
Depend on it
Run this command:

### With Flutter:
```
 $ flutter pub add flutter_doc_scanner
```
This will add a line like this to your package's `pubspec.yam`l (and run an implicit flutter pub get):
```
dependencies:
  flutter_doc_scanner: ^0.0.8
```
Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:
```
import 'package:flutter_doc_scanner/flutter_doc_scanner.dart';
```
Example in main.dart
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:flutter_doc_scanner/flutter_doc_scanner.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  dynamic _scannedDocuments;

  Future<void> scanDocument() async {
    dynamic scannedDocuments;
    try {
      scannedDocuments = await FlutterDocScanner().getScanDocuments() ??
          'Unknown platform documents';
    } on PlatformException {
      scannedDocuments = 'Failed to get scanned documents.';
    }
    print(scannedDocuments.toString());
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() {
      _scannedDocuments = scannedDocuments;
    });
  }

  Future<void> scanDocumentUri() async {
    dynamic scannedDocuments;
    try {
      scannedDocuments = await FlutterDocScanner().getScanDocumentsUri() ??
          'Unknown platform documents';
    } on PlatformException {
      scannedDocuments = 'Failed to get scanned documents.';
    }
    print(scannedDocuments.toString());
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() {
      _scannedDocuments = scannedDocuments;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Document Scanner example app'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Column(
            children: [
              _scannedDocuments != null
                  ? Text(_scannedDocuments.toString())
                  : const Text("No Documents Scanned"),
            ],
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: Padding(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 16.0),
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.end,
            children: [
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0),
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    scanDocument();
                  },
                  child: const Text("Scan Documents"),
                ),
              ),
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0),
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    scanDocumentUri();
                  },
                  child: const Text("Get Scan Documents URI"),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Settings
There must be an option to set the following settings in JSON
```json

    }
    "auth_endpoint": "auth/login/",
    "auth_username"

    "gps_log_interval": 1, // in minutes
    "gps_log_distance": 100, // in meters
    "gps_log_distance_unit": "meters", // meters or kilometers
    "gps_log_distance_unit_short": "m", // m or km

}
```

## General

- Whenever a location is logged the address must be logged (There must be a field where an address can be entered and auto completed with the google maps api)
- The GPS Coordinates must be logged with the date and time

## 1. Features needed
- Cash withdrawal log from company card
  - The user must be able to scan a company card and save the card number and the card holder name
  - The user must be able to scan the slip the the ATM produced after the transaction
  - The amount of money withdrawn must be logged with the date, time and the location
  - 
- Travel tracking with fuel expenses, time spent, kilometers driven
The option tonshare a ride or to share part of a ride.
- To have multiple stops as part of one trip.
- save the route that was driven per stop and that accumelates to a trip that again accumelates to a job
- To add a new vehicle the user must be able to scan a south african licence disc
- then it must ask for the current vehicle kilometers with an option to take a photo that must OCR
- Also to take a photo of the number plate that must also crop and save. 
- Then a photo of the car all 4 sides
- then it musy ask for the vehicle make and model and year and color.
- The only details that is required from a vehicle before a trip is the licence disc and starting kilometers. 
- The driver should also be prompted to take a photo of his Driver's licence
 - All of these things will get submitted to an api that will respond with json so for now, create json files that we can use for mock endpounts.
- With all slips that gets scanned the text must be identified with ocr, location data must be imbedded in all the photos. With the date and time.
- Historic stuff can also be scanned so bwsides just imbedding the details, there must be additional fields tht default to current location and the date but can be updated 

Make a comprehensive list of all the features we will need to implement  and what we will be getting from the lib. Then give me a listbof tasks and sub tasks wherr no fask or sub task will take longer than 25 minutes.. Number the tasks with decimals
