### **Comprehensive Travel and Expense Management Mobile Application - Technical Specification**

#### **1. Project Overview**

This project involves the development of a cross-platform mobile application that will manage business travel activities, including vehicle usage, cash withdrawals, document scanning, and dynamic API integrations. The app will support the logging of detailed trip information, including GPS tracking, and the ability to split trips between multiple users. All data will be linked to projects, enabling users to organize their activities and expenses effectively. The app must be highly configurable, supporting dynamic API endpoints, field mappings, and database schema updates through JSON configuration files. The application will work both online and offline, with synchronization capabilities when an internet connection is available.
