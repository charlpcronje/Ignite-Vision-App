# Ignite Vision

Ignite Vision is a comprehensive Flutter application designed for efficient expense tracking, travel management, and vehicle logging. This app allows employees and contractors to seamlessly log expenses, track travel costs, and manage vehicle-related information. The application is built with a focus on dynamic configuration, allowing for easy updates to API endpoints, field mappings, and UI elements without requiring app updates.

Key features include:
- Dynamic configuration using JSON files loaded from a remote server
- Cash withdrawal logging with company card scanning
- Travel tracking with GPS integration and multi-user trip sharing
- Vehicle management with document scanning (license disc, odometer) using OCR
- Expense management with receipt scanning and categorization
- Offline support with local data storage and synchronization
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

The application utilizes Flutter for cross-platform development, integrates with RESTful APIs for data management, and incorporates advanced features such as OCR for document scanning and SQLite for local data storage. The app's flexibility is enhanced by its ability to dynamically adjust based on remotely loaded configuration files.
