Got it! Here's a more detailed explanation:

Project Setup 
Follow the steps below to set up your Flutter project on Android and iOS.

Android 
Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on Android devices. In the android/app/build.gradle file, verify that minSdkVersion is at least 21. This setting specifies the minimum Android API level required to run your app, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of Android devices.

android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
    ...
}
iOS 
Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on iOS devices. In the ios/Podfile file, make sure the iOS platform version is at least 13.0. This setting specifies the minimum iOS version required to run your app, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of iOS devices.

platform :ios, '13.0'
Permission Configuration
Add a String property to the app's Info.plist file with the key NSCameraUsageDescription and the value as the description for why your app needs camera access. This step is required by Apple to explain to users why the app needs access to the camera, and it's crucial for App Store approval.
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Camera Permission Description</string>
The permission_handler dependency used by flutter_doc_scanner uses macros to control whether a permission is enabled. To enable camera permission, add the following to your Podfile file. This step ensures that your app can request and handle camera permissions on iOS devices:
  post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      ... # Here are some configurations automatically generated by flutter

      # Start of the permission_handler configuration
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|

        # You can enable the permissions needed here. For example, to enable camera
        # permission, just remove the `#` character in front so it looks like this:
        #
        # ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
        # 'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1'
        #
        #  Preprocessor definitions can be found at: https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h
        config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
          '$(inherited)',

          ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
          'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',
        ]

      end
      # End of the permission_handler configuration
    end
  end
Usage 
import 'package:flutter_doc_scanner/flutter_doc_scanner.dart';

// Use the `FlutterDocScanner` class to start the document scanning process.
dynamic scannedDocuments;
try {
  scannedDocuments = await FlutterDocScanner().getScanDocuments() ??
      'Unknown platform documents';
} on PlatformException {
  scannedDocuments = 'Failed to get scanned documents.';
}
print(scannedDocuments.toString());
