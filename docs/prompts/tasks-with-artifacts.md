# Ignite Vision

Ignite Vision is a comprehensive Flutter application designed for efficient expense tracking, travel management, and vehicle logging. This app allows employees and contractors to seamlessly log expenses, track travel costs, and manage vehicle-related information. The application is built with a focus on dynamic configuration, allowing for easy updates to API endpoints, field mappings, and UI elements without requiring app updates.

Key features include:
- Cash withdrawal logging from company cards
- Travel tracking with fuel expenses, time spent, and kilometers driven
- Multi-user trip sharing with cost splitting
- Vehicle management with South African license disc scanning
- Document scanning and OCR for various purposes
- Real-time GPS tracking and location history
- Offline support with background synchronization
- Expense and trip reporting with data visualization

The application utilizes Flutter for cross-platform development, integrates with RESTful APIs for data management, and incorporates advanced features such as OCR for document scanning and SQLite for local data storage. The app's configuration, including API endpoints and field mappings, is dynamically loaded from remote JSON files, allowing for easy updates and customization without requiring app redeployment.

```

I've reached a point where continuing in this context might approach the limit. To ensure we maintain the quality and completeness of the task list, I suggest we continue this conversation in a new context window. This will allow me to provide detailed information for the remaining modules without any constraints. Would you like me to summarize the progress so far before we move to a new context, or shall we proceed directly to the next module in a fresh conversation?
</response>

Please give me a prompt that I can give you so that you will be able to continue with the same detailed task generation with the artifacts etc, and tell which files I must attach to the new context window

<response>
Certainly. To continue with the detailed task generation in a new context window, please use the following prompt:

"Please continue generating detailed tasks for the Ignite Vision app, including artifacts for each file. Start with the next module after GPS and Location Services. Maintain the same level of detail and format as before, ensuring each task is comprehensive and aligned with the project specifications."

For the new context window, please attach the following files:

1. technical_spec.md
2. api_spec.md
3. flutter-doc-scanner.md

These files contain the essential project specifications and API details that will be necessary for generating accurate and relevant tasks for the remaining modules. By including these, I'll be able to refer to the correct information and maintain consistency with the project requirements.

When you start the new context, I'll pick up from where we left off and continue with the next module in the project, ensuring that all tasks are covered thoroughly and in line with the project specifications.
</response>

Please continue generating detailed tasks for the Ignite Vision app, including artifacts for each file. Start with the next module after GPS and Location Services. Maintain the same level of detail and format as before, ensuring each task is comprehensive and aligned with the project specifications."
The following files must be referenced for carrying on with creating this very detailed task list:
1. technical_spec.md
2. api_spec.md
3. flutter-doc-scanner.md

Following these instruction and start from 8 again
Use artifacts for creating files. When you get to each part of a task / sub-task where you list the files that must be created / edited for that task, then create an artifact for that file and do the following: - Put the relative path and file name on the first line in comments - Write a description of what the file is for and which tasks cover the creating or editing of the file - Do not give me any code yet, like in nothing rather do the following: - Add a description to the file in comments - Add TODO: comments to the file of everything there is to do in that file - If it is not clear what the best implementation is for the file, then reason in about the best implementation within the file in comments. - Also add if there are any important stuff to remember regarding the stuff that will be created in the file
We are doing the above so that during the second run we do across all of the files in a new context window where I will give you all the files back again, then you will be assisting with all the implementation, this is so that we can be sure we do not miss anything and that the planning is all done correctly and that the everything will work before we begin creating code that may not be the best way or maybe not even viable and we spend hours refactoring everything Again, do not worry about brevity or the response limit, be comprehensive with each and every task and sub-task, never give shortened responses, be detailed and precise and focus on making each task and sub-task so that it explains everything needed to complete the task and be sure to add all the relative JSON files to the response and where they were incomplete, please complete them by taking the ones before them as an example

<response>
Certainly, I understand. I'll start from task 8 again, using artifacts for creating files and following your instructions. I'll provide detailed descriptions, TODO comments, and reasoning within each file artifact without actual code implementation. Let's begin:

```

Now, as requested, I'll review previous sections for any potential improvements or missed items:

1. In the Document Scanning module (Section 8), we should add support for batch scanning of multiple documents. Let's update the document_scanner_service.dart file:



```dart
// lib/services/document_scanner_service.dart

/*
 * This service provides document scanning functionality,

```

These updates address some potential improvements in the document scanning and trip management modules. Would you like me to continue with reviewing other sections or move on to the final sections of the project?
</response>

Okay, Now think about the navigation and what there should be and in some screens we might want to be able to visit other screens to check something and come  back and not lose what we were busy with

Then something that will have to catered and this can be noted as general that counts for all sections. All expenses and trips and everything must be logged against a project, so the current project must be shown on each page but must not be in the way and when the user taps on the project name it must show the list of projecs, this list must be retreived with an api endpoint /projects with the GET methods, you can give me a json example of what such data could look like

<response>
You're absolutely right. Let's address the navigation and project-based logging, as these are crucial aspects of the app's usability and functionality.

First, let's consider the navigation:

1. Implement a bottom navigation bar for main sections:
   - Home/Dashboard
   - Trips
   - Expenses
   - Vehicles
   - More (for additional options)

2. Use a drawer navigation for less frequently accessed screens:
   - Settings
   - Profile
   - Help & Support
   - About

3. Implement a stack-based navigation within each main section to allow users to dive deeper into details and return easily.

4. Add a "breadcrumb" style navigation at the top of detail screens to show the user's current location in the app hierarchy.

Now, let's address the project-based logging:



```dart
// lib/widgets/project_selector_widget.dart

/*
 * This widget provides a consistent interface for selecting and displaying
 * the current project across different screens of the app.
 *
 * Tasks covered:
 * - Implement project-based logging
 * - Provide quick access to project selection
 */

// TODO: Import necessary packages (flutter, project_service, etc.)

// TODO: Create ProjectSelectorWidget class

// TODO: Implement state management for current project

// TODO: Create a compact display for the current project name

// TODO: Implement onTap functionality to open project list

// TODO: Create a modal bottom sheet for project selection

// TODO: Implement search functionality within the project list

// TODO: Add functionality to fetch and display projects from API

// TODO: Implement caching of recently used projects for quick access

// TODO: Create method to notify parent widgets of project changes

// TODO: Implement error handling for project fetch failures

/*
 * Implementation considerations:
 * 1. Ensure the widget is easily integratable into various screens without disrupting layout.
 * 2. Implement smooth animations for opening and closing the project list.
 * 3. Consider adding a "Create New Project" option within the selector.
 * 4. Ensure the widget handles long project names gracefully.
 * 5. Implement proper state management to reflect project changes across the app.
 * 6. Consider adding visual indicators for different project types or statuses.
 */

```

Now, let's define the API endpoint for fetching projects and provide a JSON example of what the data could look like:

API Endpoint: GET /projects

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "projects": [
      {
        "id": "proj-001",
        "name": "Office Renovation",
        "code": "OR-2024",
        "status": "active",
        "start_date": "2024-03-01",
        "end_date": "2024-06-30",
        "client": "ACME Corp",
        "budget": 150000.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "description": "Complete renovation of ACME Corp's main office",
        "manager": "John Doe"
      },
      {
        "id": "proj-002",
        "name": "Product Launch Campaign",
        "code": "PLC-2024",
        "status": "planning",
        "start_date": "2024-05-15",
        "end_date": "2024-08-31",
        "client": "TechStart Inc",
        "budget": 75000.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "description": "Marketing campaign for TechStart's new product line",
        "manager": "Jane Smith"
      },
      {
        "id": "proj-003",
        "name": "Annual Sales Conference",
        "code": "ASC-2024",
        "status": "active",
        "start_date": "2024-09-10",
        "end_date": "2024-09-12",
        "client": "Internal",
        "budget": 50000.00,
        "currency": "USD",
        "description": "Annual sales team conference and training event",
        "manager": "Mike Johnson"
      }
    ],
    "total_count": 3,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

To implement this, we should create a project service:



```dart
// lib/services/project_service.dart

/*
 * This service handles all project-related operations, including
 * fetching projects from the API and managing the current project.
 *
 * Tasks covered:
 * - Fetch and manage projects
 * - Handle current project selection
 */

// TODO: Import necessary packages (http, shared_preferences, etc.)

// TODO: Create ProjectService class

// TODO: Implement method to fetch projects from API

// TODO: Add pagination support for fetching large numbers of projects

// TODO: Create method to get current project

// TODO: Implement method to set current project

// TODO: Add caching for frequently accessed project data

// TODO: Implement search functionality for projects

// TODO: Create method to fetch project details by ID

// TODO: Add functionality to create new projects

// TODO: Implement method to update project details

// TODO: Create functionality to archive or delete projects

// TODO: Implement error handling for all API operations

/*
 * Implementation considerations:
 * 1. Ensure efficient caching and retrieval of project data to minimize API calls.
 * 2. Implement proper error handling and retry logic for failed API requests.
 * 3. Consider implementing a local database for offline access to project data.
 * 4. Ensure thread-safety when accessing and updating the current project.
 * 5. Implement proper event notifications for project changes to update UI across the app.
 * 6. Consider adding analytics tracking for project usage and interactions.
 */

```

To ensure that all expenses, trips, and other relevant data are logged against a project, we should:

1. Update all relevant service classes (ExpenseService, TripService, etc.) to include a project ID parameter in their create and update methods.
2. Modify all relevant UI screens to include the ProjectSelectorWidget.
3. Implement logic to prevent the creation or modification of data without an associated project.
4. Update the database schema and API requests to include project IDs in all relevant tables and endpoints.

These changes will ensure that the current project is always visible and selectable, and that all data is properly associated with projects throughout the app.

What I am going to do now is create all of the files you gave me above and add all the todo's in them. Then I am going to start a new context window with all of the files combined in one markdown document in code blocks. 

From there I am going to need you to give me the production ready code to replace the todo's in each file. After every response I want to be able to test what we have done so please give me a detailed prompt to explain in the next context window what we are doing.

That sounds like an excellent plan. Creating the files with TODOs and then implementing the actual code in a new context will help ensure a comprehensive and organized approach to development. Here's what I suggest for the next steps:

1. Create all the files mentioned in the artifacts, including the TODOs.

2. Compile these files into a single markdown document with code blocks for each file.

3. In the new context window, provide the markdown document containing all the files.

4. I will then start implementing the production-ready code to replace the TODOs in each file, one file at a time.

5. After each file is completed, I'll provide a detailed explanation of what was implemented and how to test it.

6. You can then implement and test the code before moving on to the next file.

This approach will allow us to:
- Maintain a clear overview of the entire project structure
- Implement each component systematically
- Test each part of the application as we go
- Ensure that all parts of the app are working together correctly

When you're ready with the markdown document containing all the files with TODOs, please provide it in the new context window. I'll then begin with the implementation of the first file, provide the code, and give you detailed instructions on how to test it.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or address before we move to the implementation phase?
